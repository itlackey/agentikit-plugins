# Agentikit Stash

You have access to the `agentikit` CLI to manage extension assets from a stash directory.

The stash directory is configured via the `AGENTIKIT_STASH_DIR` environment variable and contains:

- **tools/** — executable scripts (.sh, .ts, .js, .ps1, .cmd, .bat)
- **skills/** — skill directories containing SKILL.md
- **commands/** — markdown template files
- **agents/** — markdown agent definition files

## Commands

### Build the search index

Scan stash directories, auto-generate missing `.stash.json` metadata, and build a semantic search index.

```bash
agentikit index
```

Run this after adding new extensions to enable semantic search ranking.

### Search the stash

Find assets using a two-stage search pipeline: ripgrep pre-filters `.stash.json` metadata files for fast candidate discovery, then TF-IDF ranks results by semantic relevance. Falls back to name substring matching when no index exists.

```bash
agentikit search [query] [--type tool|skill|command|agent|any] [--limit N]
```

### Open an asset

Retrieve the full content/payload of an asset using its `openRef` from search results.

```bash
agentikit open <openRef>
```

Returns type-specific payloads:
- **skill** → full SKILL.md content
- **command** → markdown template + description
- **agent** → prompt + description, toolPolicy, modelHint
- **tool** → execution command and kind

### Run a tool

Execute a tool asset by its `openRef`. Only tool refs are supported.

```bash
agentikit run <openRef>
```

Returns the tool's stdout/stderr output and exit code.

## Dependencies

`agentikit init` will auto-install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to `stash/bin/` if not already on PATH. Ripgrep is used for fast candidate filtering during search.

## Workflow

1. Initialize: `agentikit init` (creates stash dirs, installs ripgrep)
2. Build the index: `agentikit index`
3. Search for assets: `agentikit search "deploy" --type tool`
4. Inspect a result: `agentikit open <openRef>`
5. Run a tool: `agentikit run <openRef>`

All output is JSON for easy parsing.
